# ChatOps Manual Test Plan — Browser Execution Guide

## Setup

1. Open your browser on Windows
2. Navigate to the ChatOps URL (e.g. `http://<server-ip>:8001/chatops`)
3. You should see the **ChatOps Console** with a chat input at the bottom
4. Type each message exactly as shown and compare the response

**How to mark results:**
- ✅ PASS — response matches the expected output
- ❌ FAIL — response is missing expected content or shows an error

**Note:** Values like percentages, port numbers, process names, and timestamps
will differ on your machine — focus on the **keywords and structure**, not exact numbers.

---

## Section 1 — Help & Welcome

---

### TC-01 · Hint Text in Header Bar

**Action:** Open the chatbot URL in the browser (no typing needed)

**Expected — blue header bar shows:**
```
ChatOps Console
disk · memory · cpu · health · ports · type help for all commands
```

The hint text appears as a small subtitle line directly below the title inside the blue bar.
The word **help** appears slightly brighter than the rest.

If you have previously used the chatbot, old messages appear in the chat window below a
`— previous session —` divider. The chat window itself has NO automatic welcome bubble.

**Pass if:**
- Hint text is visible in the blue header (not in the chat window)
- Chat window opens directly at the last message (no scrolling past a welcome bubble)
- Previous session messages are separated by the `— previous session —` label

---

### TC-02 · Help Command

**Type:** `help`

**Expected response:**
```
Commands:
  check disk | check memory | check cpu | check uptime | check ports
  top processes | system health | analyze logs: <content>
  show alerts | list runbooks | run <runbook> | confirm <runbook> | cancel
  run tests | config | help
```

**Pass if:** Response lists all commands including `check disk`, `check cpu`, `top processes`, `run tests`.

---

### TC-03 · Empty Message

**Type:** *(press Enter with nothing typed — or just a space)*
